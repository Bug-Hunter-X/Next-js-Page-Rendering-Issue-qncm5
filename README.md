# Next.js Page Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where the page content fails to render correctly.  The application might display nothing, or show an unexpected error message.

## Bug

The `pages/index.js` file contains a simple component that should render 'Hello, world!', but it doesn't.  The issue arises from various potential problems (missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, etc.) that would normally cause a blank screen or a server error. The provided example is a simplification.

## Solution

The solution addresses the underlying problem.  While this specific example works fine, a true bug would involve finding and resolving the root cause (like missing or incorrect dependencies, typos, or configuration issues).  This solution provides a basic working example to highlight the concept of identifying and correcting the issue.
